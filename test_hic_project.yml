    # A more technical option, use a custom script to split fastq files from SRA 
    # into two files, one per read side. By default it is true, which is

parse:
    # If 'make_pairsam' is True, parsed Hi-C pairs will store complete
    # alignment records in the SAM format (the resulting hybrid between the
    # .pairs and .sam formats is called '.pairsam'). Such files can be useful for
    # thorough investigation of Hi-C data. Downstream of parsing, pairsams
    # are split into .pairs and .bam, and .bam alignments are tagged with
    # Hi-C related information. 'make_pairsam' roughly doubles the storage
    # and I/O requirements and should be used only when absolutely needed.
    # NOTE: when 'make_pairsam' is False, the initial output of parsing is still
    # called '.pairsam' despite missing SAM alignments, for technical reasons.

    # When 'keep_unparsed_bams' is True, distiller preserves the _immediate_
    # output of bwa in a .bam format. Could be used as a faster alternative
    # to 'make_pairsam' when alignments are needed, but tagging them with Hi-C
    # related information is not necessary.

    # Pass extra options to pairtools parse, on top of the ones specified by
